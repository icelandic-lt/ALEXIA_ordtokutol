This is an example of the type of files to be used with the user-defined version of ALEXIA. The format of this corpus is a number of txt-files that can be stored either in the top directory or a number of subdirectories within the top directory. Do not hesitate to modify the code in order to adapt it to your own corpus format. Also notice that the output does not include certain things. For example, words -starting or ending- in a hyphen are not included. Numbers 125693 are not included and symbols !#""%()% are not included. If you provide a filter/stop-word database, those words are not included.
